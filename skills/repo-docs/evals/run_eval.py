Scenario: a user runs the order check command with one order payload. The input is an order id and item count. The hard part is that the runner must reject empty orders before writing a report. Success is a report artifact that records accepted orders only.

## Step 1: The request becomes a checked order

The run starts with a user-visible command and turns the payload into a checked order. This phase exists because an empty order would make the report look successful while carrying no item data. The guard in `src/orders.py` rejects that boundary before writing.

## Step 2: The checked order becomes a report

After validation, the writer stores the report path for downstream checks. The important state change is that accepted item counts become report rows, while invalid orders leave no artifact.

## Verification

Run `python -m pytest tests/test_orders.py` and inspect `reports/order.txt`.

Order validation is the rule that stops an empty order before report writing.

The walkthrough first uses it when the incoming payload needs a trustworthy item count. The pressure is simple: report rows should only describe accepted orders. The guard lives in `src/orders.py`.

场景：用户运行订单检查命令，并传入一个订单 payload。输入是订单 id 和 item count。难点是运行器必须在写报告前拒绝空订单。成功输出是一份只记录有效订单的报告。

## Step 1: 请求变成已检查订单

系统先把用户可见的命令转换成已检查订单。这个阶段存在，是因为空订单会让报告看起来成功，但没有真实 item 数据。边界由 `src/orders.py` 里的校验保护。

## Step 2: 已检查订单变成报告

通过校验后，写入器保存报告路径，供后续检查读取。关键变化是有效 item count 进入报告行，无效订单不会留下产物。

## 验证方法

运行 `python -m pytest tests/test_orders.py`，再检查 `reports/order.txt`。
